PREFACE

Y thanks are due to the Librarians of Gonville
and Caius College and St John's College for
permitting and facilitating my use of the two manu-
scripts of the play. My notes show that Ι have
derived valuable assistance from my friends Mr R. B.
M⁶Kerrow, the editor of Nashe‚ and Professor Bang
of Louvain‚ the founder and editor of the Materialien
zur Kunde des dlteren Englischen Dramas. To both of
them I return my sincere thanks.

I have been commissioned by the Syndics of the
University Press to follow up the present publication
with two other Latin plays to be issued in the same
form, viz. ‘F ucus or Histriomastix’ acted at Queens'
College in 162 3, and ‘ Laelia’ acted at the same college
in the last years of the preceding century.
