The source of the play is acknowledged by the author in
his Prologue to be Boccaccio’s Decamerone. More specifically,
it is the 10th story of the Fourth Day1. It is not necessary to
reproduce the story heres Sufficient to say that our author
treats it with great freedom, while retaining with much skill
points in it which lend themselves to dramatic effect.

In place of the adulterous wife and her paramour, he gives
a girl, Julia‚ and her wooer, Erophilus. The girl’s father,
Alphonsus, takes the place of the original husband, but he loses '
the medical character of the latter2, which is transferred to one
of two new characters, comic rivals of Erophilus for Julia's love,

a vainglorious doctor, Pantomagus, and a drunken German,
Fredericus Every wooer is provided with a confidant in the
shape ofa servant (Erophilus has also a friend, Camillus), while
Julia has one in her maid Amerina. In place of Boccaccio's
two usurers, we have two highwaymen and their accomplice,
an innkeeper. After an ingeniously worked out intrigue, comes

¹ The same story of Boccaccio is combined with another (the 6th story
of the Ninth Day) in the Spanish El Menandro by Matlas de los Reyes,
printed in 1636. See Miss C. B. Bourland's Bryn Mawr thesis, Boccacrio
and the Derameron in Cartilian and Catalan literature (1905), p. 114. It
is a pity that the after-history of the Decamerone in other modern literatures
than Spanish has not been worked out in Miss Bourland’s manner. .

² It is suggested by D. M. Manni‚ istoria del Decamerone (1742), that
Boccaccio’s ‘Mazzeo' is to he identified with Matthaeus Silvaticus, whose
Pandectae Medicina was printed at Venice in 1480.
