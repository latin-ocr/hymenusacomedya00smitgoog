xiv INTRODUCTION

character to part of the action such as is unknown to the plays
of Plautus and Terence. The academie playwright with his
love of a thrilling situation anticipates the author of Much Ado
about Nothing, The Merchont of Venice and The Winter’s Tale.

The important part played by Julia in the play, her suggested
elopement, and her reception of her lover in her chamber at
night, also indicate the infusion of modern and romantic elements
into the framework of classical comedy.

The greater number of characters in the play is an indication
of the same kind.

The surprise-visit of the masquers to Alphonsus' house-
and particularly the entrance thus obtained by Erophilus into
forbidden walls and the use he makes of it-these are thoroughly
romantio and anticipate RomeoendJuliet1. They owe nothing
to Boccaccio's story. y

Similarly original is the account of the banquet, the intro-
duction of riddles (a poor concession to clownery), and the
account of the relations between the highwaymen and their
accomplice the innkeeper.

In introducing the figure of the physician boastful of his
professional fame and of his power over women, the author
only varies the theme of Plautus' Miles Gloriosus, and produces
another pendant to Ralph Roister Doistcr, Textor’s Thersites,
Munday’s Captain Crackstone, and Pedantius. For the German
whose sayings in his own idiom are humorously construed
according to the meaning of the same sounds in the vernacular,
he has a model in the Carthaginien speaker in Plautus' Poenulus.

a banquet in Ford's Love’s Sacrifico, Act 111.
