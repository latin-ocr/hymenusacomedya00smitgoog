93 Burcottico...piarmaco. There are various allusions to ‘Dr Burcot’ in
Elisabethan literature. He is presumably the ‘Barchard Raurych (η’
whose letter (endorsed ‘Dr Burcott ¹) to Sir Francis Walsingham is
preserved in ‘State Pa rs Domestic (Elisabeth),’ vol cxvut. 43 under
date Nov. ab, 1577. is isa re rt on the amount of gold contained
in aton of the ore brought bacioby Captain Furbisher (F robisher).
Other references to the same business are found in the State Pa rs
under the dates Dec. 1 pingam 6th and Feb. 19th aud ayth follows .
A list of Papists in Lon on of the date Oct. (l) 1578 contained m
‘State Papers Domestic, Addenda,’ vol. xxx. contains the statement
‘Dr Burkot and Dr Good of Chaucery Lane have heard mass at Baron
Browne’s.’ In William Bullein's Dialogus against the Feuer Pestilencc
(1564, 1573, 1578—reprinted in E.E.T.S., Extra Series, No. 52), the
s aher ‘Medicus' is called in the editions following the first, ‘Dr

octub,' and is a parently intended to stand for Dr Burcot. He pro·
fesses ignorance oi the Bible and calls himself a ‘Nulla fidian’: and rt is

Reginald Scot in his Dehcoom‘e of Witchcrct 1584, p. 144) says that a
juggler and conjuret named Feats or Hil es, known to himself, sold
doctor Burcot ‘a familiar, wherby he thought to have wrought miracles,
or rather to have gained ood store of monie’ See also pp. 434, ⁵²²·
Chettle iu his Keied Hearfis Dream (1592) says of one of his characters

See Kind Hecrt's Dreom as reprinted hythe Percy Society (1841),
pp. ιι, 21 etc, by the New Shakspere society, Allusion Bookr, pp. 44,
5 3. The former reprint contains a note by Halliwell drawing attention
to MS. Harl. 6395, 315 where a story is mentioned which it ts said was
told of ‘one Dr Burcots wife' but really referred to ‘one Dr Mathia
his wife’ For all the above references 1 am indebted to Mr nexem,
who further writes ⁸ In Deloney’s Gentle Crafta Master Doctor Burhet
is introduced (ed. Lange in Paloestra 11. 77 etc). Possibly the real
man is intended, but the story told of him is evidently fictitious.’
