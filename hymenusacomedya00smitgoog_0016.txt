tale. Erophilus’ father, who has come from Venice to Padua
for his son’s funeral, sees him restored to life, and obtains for
him the hand of Julia.

Some flaws there are in the story. Although Julia is at the
end a spotless bride, her conduct has not been above reproach.
And her father, whose surgical operation has been postponed, is
left at the end of the play with this unpleasant prospect still
before him. While Pantomagus has renounced his suit after
discovering Julia's rather free behaviour, we hear nothing of
the manner in which F redericus bears his defeat.

A little concession is made to a Cambridge audience when
the scene is transferred from Salerno to Padua, the seat of a
famous university, and when the hero is made a student sent
to Padua from Venice. Opportunity is thus given for some
allusions to the natural feud of ‘ town' and ‘gowm'

The ‘sleeping-potion’ motif in our play was of course
borrowed from Boccaccio, but it is perhaps worth noting that
whereas in Boccaccio the narcotic is rather vaguely described1
and the operation to be performed is the removal of some bone
from a man’s leg, our Cambridge author makes the operation
that of ‘cutting for stone,’ and the narcotic to be employed,
opium. I am informed by my friend Dr E. W. Adams of
Sheffield that ‘cutting for stone’ was practised in a rudimentary
way by the Greeks and Romam, and also by medieval surgeons,

latter was presumably ‘hashish'
